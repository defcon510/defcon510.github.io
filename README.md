# DC510: Global Thermonuclear Hangover
Meetings are usually on the second Monday of each month, immediately following Cyberpunk Cinema at the Knockout SF.

Our next regularly scheduled meeting is:

### August 12, 2019 (Monday) *WE'LL ALL BE DRIVING HOME OR ASLEEP OR SOMETHING*
### Knockout SF (3223 Mission St, San Francisco, .5 miles from the 24th Street BART)
### So the next date for a DC510 meeting is August 12, which is one day after DEFCON, at the Knockout SF. If you're still alive after all that and can load your wrecked carcass onto a BART train, feel free to show up there! The movie is Wargames, because of course it is. We won't be there, we'll all be asleep. Probably. Maybe. Say hi if you see us anyway.


If you have any additional questions, email

Please do not talk business in depth over e-mail. If you're going to be late and want us to wait up after the movie (or if you just want to skip the movie and come to the meeting), send an RSVP and we'll wait around for you.
If you just want to follow us on twitter, we're @_dc510


**Knockout SF, isn't that..?**

It's SF, yeah. DC510 meetings will always be near a BART station. For now, Cyberpunk Cinema is a friendly environment, and it's conveniently close in time and location to Deathguild. We can move if we find a find a better venue, and are exploring meeting more than once each month. Be advised, the folks at The Knockout are super nice and will not vomit on you for trying to enjoy their wonderful establishment. Drinks are super cheap there at any hour, too.


**Why Does DC510 Exist?**

The Bay Area has no shortage of hackers. Around here, you can get ethical hacking classes, corporate hackathons, and (actually) some of the best hackerspaces in the world. It's a high-tech environment, but that environment caters more to the kind of security professionals who attend Blackhat, and less the kind of hackers who go to DEFCON. The real hacker groups in the area are stagnant; SF2600 is a dwindling population that never outreaches or does activities past bar meetings (or actually goes to DEFCON?), and DC415 is now an online-only arm of hispagatos.


**What's a hacker?**

DC510 is for abusers of technology. We wonâ€™t fight you over the definition of hacker beyond that. Cyberpunks welcome.
