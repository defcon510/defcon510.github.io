# DC510: It's The Future Y'all
Meetings are usually on the second Monday of each month, immediately following Cyberpunk Cinema at the Knockout SF.

Our next regularly scheduled meeting is:

### January 13, 2020 (Monday)
### Knockout SF (3223 Mission St, San Francisco, .5 miles from the 24th Street BART)
### Next meeting is Monday, January 13, and we don't know what the movie is going to be. We'll update again when we find out, unless we forget. Anyway, figure on a meeting at about 9:15 - 9:30.


If you have any additional questions, email
address dc510 at the domain protonmail dot com
Please do not talk business in depth over e-mail. If you're going to be late and want us to wait up after the movie (or if you just want to skip the movie and come to the meeting), send an RSVP and we'll wait around for you.
If you just want to follow us on twitter, we're @_dc510


**Knockout SF, isn't that..?**

It's SF, yeah. DC510 meetings will always be near a BART station. For now, Cyberpunk Cinema is a friendly environment, and it's conveniently close in time and location to Deathguild. We can move if we find a find a better venue, and are exploring meeting more than once each month. Be advised, the folks at The Knockout are super nice and will not vomit on you for trying to enjoy their wonderful establishment. Drinks are super cheap there at any hour, too.


**Why Does DC510 Exist?**

The Bay Area has no shortage of hackers. Around here, you can get ethical hacking classes, corporate hackathons, and (actually) some of the best hackerspaces in the world. It's a high-tech environment, but that environment caters more to the kind of security professionals who attend Blackhat, and less the kind of hackers who go to DEFCON. The real hacker groups in the area are stagnant; SF2600 is a dwindling population that never outreaches or does activities past bar meetings (or actually goes to DEFCON?), and DC415 is now an online-only arm of hispagatos.


**What's a hacker?**

DC510 is for abusers of technology. We wonâ€™t fight you over the definition of hacker beyond that. Cyberpunks welcome.
