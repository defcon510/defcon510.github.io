# DC510: Our Hangovers Have Worn Off
Meetings are currently on the second Monday of each month, immediately following Cyberpunk Cinema at the Knockout SF.


Right now, though, we have a special meeting for August because our regular meeting day fell on the Monday just after defcon, and we were all hung over.
The new August meeting is:
### August 24 (Friday), Arrive at 8:30 PM - 9:00 PM. We'll walk somewhere else after that.
### The Lawn at the Corner of Lake Merritt Drive and Lakeside Drive in Oakland
### Send us an email if you're running late and need us to stick around.





The next regularly scheduled meeting is:

### September 10, 2018 (Monday)
### Knockout SF (3223 Mission St, walking distance of the 24th Street BART)
### The movie this time is Cherry 2000, a film that made $14,000 at the box office. The movie starts at 7:00, runs 93 minutes, and will probably end around 8:45. Watch this space for more info when we find out, and email us if you want us to stick around to see you.


If you have any additional questions, email
address dc510 at the domain protonmail dot com
Please do not talk business in depth over e-mail. If you're going to be late and want us to wait up after the movie (or if you just want to skip the movie and come to the meeting), send an RSVP and we'll wait around for you.


**Knockout SF, isn't that..?**

It's SF, yeah. DC510 meetings will always be near a BART station. For now, Cyberpunk Cinema is a friendly environment, and it's conveniently close in time and location to Deathguild. We can move if we find a find a better venue, and are exploring meeting more than once each month. Be advised, the folks at The Knockout are super nice and will not vomit on you for trying to enjoy their wonderful establishment.


**Why Does DC510 Exist?**

The Bay Area has no shortage of hackers. Around here, you can get ethical hacking classes, corporate hackathons, and (actually) some of the best hackerspaces in the world. It's a high-tech environment, but that environment caters more to the kind of security professionals who attend Blackhat, and less the kind of hackers who go to DEFCON. The real hacker groups in the area are stagnant; SF2600 is a dwindling population that never outreaches or does activities past bar meetings (or actually goes to DEFCON?), and DC415 is now an online-only arm of hispagatos.


**What's a hacker?**

DC510 is for abusers of technology. We wonâ€™t fight you over the definition of hacker beyond that. Cyberpunks welcome.
