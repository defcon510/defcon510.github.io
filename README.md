remember your sunblock

If you have any additional questions, email

Please do not talk business in depth over e-mail. We used to say "RSVP if you want us to wait" but contact methods have become unreliable with recent changes to Twitter and Protonmail.

**Why Does DC510 Exist?**

The Bay Area has no shortage of hackers. Around here, you can get ethical hacking classes, corporate hackathons, and (actually) some of the best hackerspaces in the world. It's a high-tech environment, but that environment caters more to the kind of security professionals who attend Blackhat, and less the kind of hackers who go to DEFCON. The real hacker groups in the area are stagnant; SF2600 is a dwindling population that never outreaches or does activities past bar meetings (or actually goes to DEFCON?), and DC415 was last we checked (July 6 2021 thanks for your concern) an online-only arm of hispagatos (we still love you rek2).


**What's a hacker?**

DC510 is for abusers of technology. We wonâ€™t fight you over the definition of hacker beyond that. Cyberpunks welcome.
